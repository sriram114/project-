Body Fat Prediction:
             Fat is stored energy. When you eat, your body transforms carbohydrates, protein, and dietary fat into fatty acids (chains of molecules that are the building blocks of body fat), glucose (blood sugar), or amino acids. These provide energy that you either burn right away or pack up for later. Without body fat, you'd have to eat all the time just to keep your body functioning your heart beating, your eyes moving to read this article and your hand travelling to the packet of crisps on your desk.
            Fat that isn't used right away gets stored in cells. If you looked at a cell under a microscope you would see that fat makes up about 85% of the cell's volume. Fat cells typically start at 5 millionths of a meter in diameter, too tiny to be seen by the naked eye. But each one can increase by 100 times in volume, to the size of the full stop  which is big for a cell.
